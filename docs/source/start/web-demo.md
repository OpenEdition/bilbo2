# Demonstration


There is a online demonstration of Bilbo2
* [http://openedition.huma-num.fr/bilbo-api/](http://openedition.huma-num.fr/bilbo-api/) 

In this demonstrator, only bibliographic reference and footnote is processing. The corpus is trained on french and english dataset. 
Just paste each bibliographic references surrounded by tag `<bibl>` or `<note>` and click on annotate. You already have pre-loaded examples. 

This instance is for test purposes only and should therefore not be used as production tools. For a production usage you should contact <mathieu.orban@openedition.org>.
The data processing is not kept at all.
In the future, a full REST web-API is programming. This REST-API should integrate the research of Digital Object Identifier ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) for each bibliographics references processed.
